 üåç TripAdvisor Clone (HTML & CSS)

I created a fully responsive **TripAdvisor clone** using only **HTML** and **CSS**, as part of my weekly project challenge. This project showcases my ability to design structured web pages, create modern layouts, and implement responsive styling without using any JavaScript or frameworks.

**Key Features:**

* Clean and attractive UI inspired by the original TripAdvisor site
* Responsive design for mobile and desktop views
* Organized content layout using Flexbox and media queries
* Custom icons, buttons, and cards built with pure CSS

**Tools Used:**
`HTML5`, `CSS3`, `Font Awesome`, `Google Fonts`

This project helped strengthen my skills in front-end web design and layout techniques using only core technologies.
